## Welcome to My Main repository
#### Here you will find the .CSS file associated with my Bootstrap Download. I chose to go with a Carousel template, because it looked to organize the information for highlighting my projects in the way I was thinking. On the Html file you will see that I am linking a Youtube video with a 20 second introduction. and lastly I embedded a Picture to Add for context.
